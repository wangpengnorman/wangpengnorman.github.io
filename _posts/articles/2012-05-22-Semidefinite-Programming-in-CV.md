excerpt: "A variety of CV problems can be formulated as Binary Quadratic Problems (BQP), such as segmentation, image registration/matching and image denoising/restoration. We developed several fast and accurate BQP solvers based on semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. Details can be found in our publications in TPAMI, IJCV and CVPR. "
