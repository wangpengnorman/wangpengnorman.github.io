excerpt: "Instance-level Recognition and Re-identification
Recognizing object instances of the same category (such as face, person, car) is challenging due to the large intra-instance variation and small inter-instance variation. We constructed a large dataset for vehicle re-identification from aerial view and were top-ranked in related AI competitions.  "
